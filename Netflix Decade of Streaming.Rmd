## Research Question

*What is the question you hope to answer with your data visualization?*

With the help of the visualization I would like to show the understanding of  what movies, shows, and other contents available in different countries, Movie ratings analysis and many more.


* * *

# Data

## Description of data


This tabular dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc. This data is taken from Tableau Sample dataset.

## Load data into R

*Include the code to load your data here. Using the head() function, show the first 10 rows of data. *

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
netflix <- read.csv("netflix_titles.csv")
```

* * *

# Variables

*Using the names() function, show the names of all the columns (i.e. potential variables) in your data set. Delete this when complete.*
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
names(netflix)
```

The variables I used in my data visualization design are:

1. show_id
2. type
3. title
4. director
5. cast
6. country
7. date_added
8. release_year
9. rating
10. duration
11. listed_in
12. description
* * *

# Data Analysis

## Summary Statistics


```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
favstats('netflix')
```

> Provide the high-level insights you used to craft your data visualization design.

## Additional Analyses

*If you conducted any other analyses of your data set to gather the data in your project, use this section to conduct your research. Delete this when complete.*
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
df_by_date <- netflix %>% group_by(date_added,type) %>% summarise(addedToday = n()) %>% 
            ungroup() %>% group_by(type) %>% mutate(Total_Number_of_Shows = cumsum(addedToday), label = if_else(date_added == max(date_added,na.rm = T), as.character(type), NA_character_))


df_show_categories <- netflix %>% 
                        select(c('show_id','type','listed_in')) %>% 
                        separate_rows(listed_in, sep = ',') %>%
                        rename(Show_Category = listed_in)



write.csv(df_show_categories, "show_categories.csv", row.names = FALSE)


```

# Interactive Presentation or Website Visualiztion

*Module 3's Project allows students to choose ONE OPTION among the two options provided below. You should denote which ONE of the two options you plan to pursue and provide a brief overview of your vision for the project. Delete the other options that you will not be pursuing.*

## Option 1 | Interactive Canva Presentation
Students will use Canva to create an interactive presentation that showcases their data findings and creates a cohesive, one-stop hub for information regarding their topics. Students must include a minimum of 5 pages of analysis, 1 page for their home, and 1 page for references/overview.
